# Product Guidelines for DevFlow.ai

## Product Vision
DevFlow.ai is an enterprise-grade AI-powered development workflow orchestrator designed to transform how development teams plan, build, and deploy software.

## Core Principles
- **AI-First Approach**: Every feature should leverage AI to reduce manual work
- **Developer Experience**: Prioritize intuitive interfaces and seamless workflows
- **Enterprise Ready**: Built for scale, security, and compliance from day one
- **Integration Focused**: Connect with existing tools rather than replace them

## Feature Requirements
- All features must support real-time collaboration
- Analytics must provide actionable insights, not just data
- Security and compliance must be built-in, not bolted-on
- Performance targets: <2s response time, 99.9% uptime

## Quality Standards
- Comprehensive test coverage (>90%)
- Type-safe TypeScript implementation
- Microservices architecture for scalability
- Event-driven design for loose coupling
