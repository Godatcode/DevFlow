# Requirements Document

## Introduction

DevFlow.ai is an enterprise-grade AI-powered development workflow orchestrator designed to transform how development teams plan, build, and deploy software. The platform leverages intelligent automation, predictive analytics, and seamless integrations to eliminate repetitive tasks and accelerate development cycles while maintaining code quality and security standards. The system addresses the core problem that development teams waste 60% of their time on manual, repetitive tasks.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Intelligent Workflow Orchestration

**User Story:** As a development team lead, I want an AI-powered orchestration system that coordinates complex workflows automatically, so that my team can focus on high-value development work instead of manual task management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a code change is committed THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger appropriate workflow events based on project context
2. WHEN multiple tasks need coordination THEN the system SHALL route tasks to the most suitable team members or automated processes
3. WHEN a workflow requires multi-agent coordination THEN the system SHALL manage agent interactions and dependencies automatically
4. IF a workflow event occurs THEN the system SHALL process it within 30 seconds with context-aware decision making

### Requirement 2: Advanced Analytics and Insights

**User Story:** As a engineering manager, I want comprehensive analytics and predictive insights about my team's performance and project timelines, so that I can make data-driven decisions and improve development efficiency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployment events occur THEN the system SHALL automatically track DORA metrics (deployment frequency, lead time, recovery time)
2. WHEN project timeline estimation is requested THEN the system SHALL provide AI-powered predictions based on historical data with 80% accuracy
3. WHEN code quality analysis runs THEN the system SHALL quantify technical debt and provide actionable recommendations
4. WHEN team performance is evaluated THEN the system SHALL generate insights using the SPACE framework metrics

### Requirement 3: Enterprise Security and Compliance

**User Story:** As a security officer, I want automated security scanning and compliance validation integrated into all development workflows, so that we maintain enterprise security standards without slowing down development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is committed THEN the system SHALL perform automated vulnerability scanning within 2 minutes
2. WHEN compliance validation is required THEN the system SHALL check against SOC2, GDPR, and HIPAA requirements automatically
3. WHEN security vulnerabilities are detected THEN the system SHALL provide automated remediation suggestions
4. WHEN any development activity occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain complete audit trails for compliance reporting

### Requirement 4: Comprehensive Integration Ecosystem

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want seamless integration with our existing development tools and cloud services, so that teams can adopt the platform without disrupting current workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating with version control THEN the system SHALL support GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket with full API functionality
2. WHEN connecting to project management tools THEN the system SHALL sync bidirectionally with Jira, Linear, and Azure DevOps
3. WHEN sending notifications THEN the system SHALL deliver real-time updates via Slack, Teams, and Discord
4. WHEN deploying to cloud services THEN the system SHALL support native AWS, GCP, and Azure pipeline integration

### Requirement 5: Automated Agent Hooks

**User Story:** As a developer, I want intelligent automation agents that handle repetitive tasks like security scanning, performance optimization, and documentation updates, so that I can focus on writing code instead of maintenance tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code changes are detected THEN the Security Guardian agent SHALL scan for vulnerabilities and report findings within 5 minutes
2. WHEN performance bottlenecks are identified THEN the Performance Optimizer agent SHALL provide specific optimization suggestions
3. WHEN code style violations occur THEN the Style Enforcer agent SHALL automatically format code according to team standards
4. WHEN new components are created THEN the Test Generator agent SHALL create comprehensive test suites with 90%+ coverage

### Requirement 6: Smart CI/CD Orchestration

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want intelligent pipeline generation and management that adapts to project requirements, so that deployment processes are optimized and reliable without manual configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new project is onboarded THEN the system SHALL generate appropriate CI/CD pipelines based on project characteristics
2. WHEN testing strategies are needed THEN the system SHALL automatically select optimal testing approaches based on code changes
3. WHEN performance issues are detected THEN the system SHALL implement monitoring and optimization automatically
4. WHEN deployment failures occur THEN the system SHALL execute disaster recovery and rollback procedures within 10 minutes

### Requirement 7: Real-Time Collaboration

**User Story:** As a team member, I want live visibility into workflow status and seamless communication integration, so that I stay informed about project progress and can collaborate effectively with my team.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN workflow status changes THEN the system SHALL provide live updates to all relevant team members within 5 seconds
2. WHEN cross-team communication is needed THEN the system SHALL facilitate integration across different communication platforms
3. WHEN progress reports are required THEN the system SHALL generate automated reports with current status and metrics
4. WHEN notifications are sent THEN the system SHALL use intelligent routing to deliver messages via the most appropriate channel

### Requirement 8: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the platform to handle enterprise-scale workloads with high availability and performance, so that it can support large development teams without degradation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is under normal load THEN it SHALL maintain 99.9% uptime SLA
2. WHEN processing workflow events THEN the system SHALL handle up to 10,000 concurrent events without performance degradation
3. WHEN scaling is required THEN the system SHALL automatically scale microservices based on demand
4. WHEN data is queried THEN the system SHALL return analytics results within 3 seconds for standard reports

### Requirement 9: User Experience and Adoption

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an intuitive interface and smooth onboarding experience, so that I can quickly adopt the platform and realize productivity benefits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new users onboard THEN the system SHALL reduce developer onboarding time by 75% compared to manual processes
2. WHEN users interact with the interface THEN the system SHALL provide responsive, intuitive navigation with mobile support
3. WHEN adoption is measured THEN the system SHALL achieve >90% active usage within 60 days of deployment
4. WHEN ROI is calculated THEN the system SHALL demonstrate >200% return within 6 months of implementation
