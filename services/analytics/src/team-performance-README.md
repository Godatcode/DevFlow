### Database Schema

The system uses dedicated tables for each SPACE component:
- `developer_satisfaction_surveys` - Satisfaction survey responses
- `productivity_metrics` - Performance and delivery metrics
- `activity_metrics` - Development activity tracking
- `communication_metrics` - Team communication data
- `efficiency_metrics` - Efficiency and timing metrics
- `team_performance_insights` - Aggregated insights and recommendations
- `performance_benchmarks` - Industry and organizational benchmarks

## Usage Examples

### Basic Team Insights Generation

```typescript
import { TeamPerformanceServiceImpl, SPACEMetricsCollectorImpl } from '@devflow/analytics';

// Initialize the service
const teamPerformanceService = new TeamPerformanceServiceImpl(
  spaceMetricsCollector,
  benchmarkRepository,
  performanceRepository
);

// Generate team insights
const insights = await teamPerformanceService.generateTeamInsights(
  'team-123',
  { start: new Date('2024-01-01'), end: new Date('2024-01-31') }
);

console.log('SPACE Metrics:', insights.spaceMetrics);
console.log('Recommendations:', insights.recommendations);
console.log('Risk Factors:', insights.riskFactors);
```

### Individual Developer Analysis

```typescript
// Generate developer profile
const profile = await teamPerformanceService.generateDeveloperProfile(
  'developer-456',
  { start: new Date('2024-01-01'), end: new Date('2024-01-31') }
);

console.log('Strengths:', profile.strengths);
console.log('Improvement Areas:', profile.improvementAreas);
console.log('Career Growth Path:', profile.careerGrowthPath);
```

### Performance Trend Tracking

```typescript
// Track trends over multiple periods
const trends = await teamPerformanceService.trackPerformanceTrends(
  'team-123',
  [currentPeriod, previousPeriod]
);

console.log('Satisfaction Trend:', trends.satisfaction);
console.log('Performance Trend:', trends.performance);
```

## Metrics Collection

### Automated Data Sources
- **Version Control Systems** (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)
- **Project Management Tools** (Jira, Linear, Azure DevOps)
- **Communication Platforms** (Slack, Teams, Discord)
- **CI/CD Pipelines** (deployment and build metrics)
- **Code Quality Tools** (SonarQube, CodeClimate)

### Manual Data Sources
- **Developer satisfaction surveys** (quarterly/monthly)
- **Peer feedback** and 360 reviews
- **Manager assessments** and one-on-ones
- **Team retrospectives** and feedback sessions

## Recommendations Engine
